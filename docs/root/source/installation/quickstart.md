# Introduction

This is the documentation for BigchainDB Server, or in other words, node - 
the BigchainDB software that is on servers (but not on clients).

## Setup Instructions for Various Cases

- Quickstart link below
- [Set up a local BigchainDB node for development, experimenting and testing](node-setup/index)
- [Set up and run a BigchainDB network](network-setup/index)

## Develop an App Test 

To develop an app that talks to a BigchainDB network, you'll want a test network to test it against. You have a few options:

1. The IPDB Test Network (or "Testnet") is a free-to-use, publicly-available test network that you can test against. It is available at [IPDB testnet](https://test.ipdb.io/).
1. You could also run a BigchainDB node on you local machine. One way is to use this node setup guide with a one-node "network" by using the all-in-one docker solution, or manual installation and configuration of the components. Another way is to use one of the deployment methods listed in the [network setup guide](network-setup/index) or in the [the docs about contributing to BigchainDB](../contributing/index).
